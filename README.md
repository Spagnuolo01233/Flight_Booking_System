# Introduction

The Flight Booking System is a simple Python application designed to manage passenger reservations on various flights. It consists of three main classes:

Passeggero: Represents a passenger with attributes like first name, last name, and ID.

Volo: Represents a flight with details such as departure, destination, flight code, and available seats. Passengers can be added to or removed from flights, and information about passengers and available seats can be displayed.

Gestisci_voli: Manages flight bookings, allowing passengers to make reservations and cancel them as needed.
